- Linear layout has horizontal orientation by default.
- LinearLayout supports assigning a weight to individual children. This attribute assigns an "importance" value to a view, and allows it to expand to fill any remaining
  space in the parent view. **Default weight is zero.**
- Use onclick in xml `android:onClick="onDigit"`. `android:onClick` is used to define the Kotlin function to be invoked in the activity when the button is clicked.
  It is a click listener.
- **wrap_content** tells your view to size itself to the dimensions required by its content.
- **match_parent** tells your view to become as big as its parent view group will allow.
- We can use **it keyword** in higher order functions when there is only single parameter.
